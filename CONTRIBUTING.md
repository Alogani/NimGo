# NimGo is open to contribution.

The only requirement is to sincerely want to ameliorate this project :-)

## Before contributing

- If you intend to make a non trivial change, I advise you to inform me via an issue first to avoid a conflict (big refactors causing conflicts are likely at this point)
- I am active, and generally will respond to any PR/issues in a delay of a few days

## Coding conventions

- PascalCase for globals
- Two-space indent if possible [#22](https://github.com/Alogani/NimGo/issues/22)
- Avoid abreviations. Long names are okay for procs and variables
  - Abreviations for short lived variables (like `p`=pointer, `i`, `j`) can be used
- Prefer explicit names and simple logic over comments.
- Limit depth of if/else (not a strict rule)
- For the rest, Nim's language naming convention apply
